'''Manatees''' ([[family (biology)|family]] '''Trichechidae''', [[genus]] '''''Trichechus''''') are large, fully aquatic, mostly [[herbivory|herbivorous]] [[marine mammal]]s sometimes known as '''sea cows'''. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing three of the four living species in the order [[Sirenia]]: the [[Amazonian manatee]] (''Trichechus inunguis''), the [[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus''), and the [[West African manatee]] (''Trichechus senegalensis''). They measure up to {{convert|4.0|m}} long, weigh as much as {{convert|590|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/animals/creaturefeature/west-indian-manatee/ West Indian Manatee Facts and Pictures – National Geographic Kids]. Kids.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; and have paddle-like flippers. The name ''manatí'' comes from the Spanish &quot;manatí&quot;, derived from the Caribbean word sometimes cited as &quot;manattouï&quot;. The etymology is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin &quot;manus&quot; (hand), and to a word used by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]], a [[pre-Columbian]] people of the [[Caribbean]], meaning &quot;breast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winger|first1=Jennifer|title=What's in a name?

==Taxonomy==
Manatees comprise three of the four living species in the order [[Sirenia]]. The fourth is the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]'s [[dugong]]. The Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals over 60 million years ago, with the closest living relatives being the [[Proboscidea]] ([[elephant]]s) and Hyracoidea ([[hyrax]]es).&lt;ref&gt;Domning, D.P., 1994, Paleontology and evolution of sirenians: Status of knowledge and research needs, in ''Proceedings of the 1st International Manatee and Dugong Research Conference'', Gainesville, Florida, 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazonian's hair color is brownish gray, and they have thick wrinkled skin often with coarse hair, or &quot;whiskers&quot;. Photos are rare; although very little is known about this species, scientists think they are similar to West Indian manatees.

==Description==
[[File:Manatee skeleton with calf.jpg|right|thumb|A [[skeleton]] of a manatee and calf, on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]
[[File:West Indian Manatee Skull.jpg|right|thumb|Skull of a West Indian manatee on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].]]
Manatees have a mass of {{convert|400|to|550|kg|lb}}, and mean length of {{convert|2.8|to|3.0|m|ft}}, with maxima of {{convert|3.6|m|ft}} and {{convert|1775|kg|lb}} seen (the females tend to be larger and heavier). When born, baby manatees have an average mass of {{convert|30|kg|lb}}. They have a large, flexible, [[prehensility|prehensile]] upper lip. They use the lip to gather food and eat, as well as using it for social interactions and communications. Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow [[sirenia]]ns, the [[dugong]]s. Their small, widely spaced eyes have eyelids that close in a circular manner. The adults have no [[incisor]] or [[canine tooth|canine]] teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not clearly differentiated into [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s and [[premolar]]s.  These teeth are continuously replaced throughout life, with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth.  This process is known as [[polyphyodont]]y and amongst the other mammals, only occurs in the [[kangaroo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Penny | first = Malcolm | title = The Secret Life of Kangaroos | publisher=Raintree Steck-Vaughn  | year = 2002 | location = Austin TX | isbn = 0-7398-4986-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Shoshani, J.|year=2000|title=Elephants: Majestic Creatures of the Wild|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0-87596-143-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;/&gt; At any given time, a manatee typically has no more than six teeth in each jaw of its mouth.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its tail is paddle-shaped, and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and dugongs; a dugong tail is fluked, similar in shape to a that of a whale.  Females have two teats, one under each flipper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amyhremleyfoundation.org/php/education/impacts/Manatee.php|title=The Florida Manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostrus).|publisher=The Amy H Remley Foundation|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants.

Manatees are unusual amongst [[mammals]] in possessing just six [[cervical vertebrae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hautier|first=Lionel|journal=PNAS|date=|year=2010|volume=107|issue=44|pages=18903–18908|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/44/18903.full|accessdate=25 July 2013|pmid=20956304|last2=Weisbecker|first2=V|last3=Sánchez-Villagra|first3=M.

==Behavior==
Apart from mothers with their young, or males following a receptive female, manatees are generally solitary animals.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Best, Robin|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 292–298|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manatees spend approximately 50% of the day sleeping submerged, surfacing for air regularly at intervals of less than 20 minutes. The remainder of the time is mostly spent grazing in shallow waters at depths of {{convert|1|-|2|m|ft}}. The [[Florida]] subspecies (''T. m. latirostris'') has been known to live up to 60 years.

===Locomotion===
Generally, manatees swim at about {{convert|5|to|8|km/h|mph|sigfig=1}}. However, they have been known to swim at up to {{convert|30|km/h|mph|sigfig=1}} in short bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savethemanatee.org/faqbehavior.htm|title=Manatee FAQ: Behavior|website=www.savethemanatee.org|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligence and learning===
[[File:Manatee attitudes.jpg|thumb|right|Manatee postures in captivity.]]
Manatees are capable of understanding discrimination tasks and show signs of complex [[Learning#Associative learning|associative learning]].  They also have good [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Gerstein|first1 = E. R.|year = 1994|title = The manatee mind: Discrimination training for sensory perception testing of West Indian manatees (''Trichechus manatus'')| journal = Marine Mammals|volume = 1|pages = 10–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrate discrimination and task-learning abilities similar to [[dolphin]]s and [[pinniped]]s in [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and visual studies.&lt;ref name=GulDie&gt;(Marine Mammal Medicine, 2001, Leslie Dierauf &amp; Frances Gulland, CRC Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Manatees typically breed once every two years; generally only a single calf is born. [[Gestation]] lasts about 12 months and a further 12 to 18 months to [[weaning|wean]] the calf.&lt;ref name=EoM /&gt;

===Communication===
Manatees emit a wide range of sounds used in communication, especially between cows and their calves. Adults communicate to maintain contact and during sexual and play behaviors. Taste and smell, in addition to sight, sound, and touch, may also be forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;https://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/manatee/communication&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
Manatees are [[herbivory|herbivore]]s and eat over 60 different freshwater ( e.g. floating hyacinth, pickerel weed, alligator weed, water lettuce, hydrilla, water celery, musk grass, [[mangrove]] leaves) and saltwater plants (e.g. sea grasses, shoal grass, manatee grass, [[seagrass|turtle grass]], widgeon grass, sea clover, and marine algae).  Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight (about 50&amp;nbsp;kg) per day. Consuming such an amount requires the manatee to graze for up to seven hours a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journey North&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/manatee/AdaptationsMouth.html|title=Manatee|publisher=Journey North|year=2003|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets.&lt;ref name=&quot;powell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Powell| first = James| title = Evidence for carnivory in manatee (''Trichechus manatus'')| journal =Journal of Mammalogy| volume = 59| issue = 2|page = 442|year = 1978| doi = 10.2307/1379938| jstor = 1379938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feeding behavior===
[[File:Manatee plate.jpg|thumbnail|Manatee plate]]
Manatees use their flippers to &quot;walk&quot; along the bottom whilst they dig for plants and roots in the substrate. When plants are detected, the flippers are used to scoop the vegetation toward the manatee's lips.  The manatee has prehensile lips; the upper lip pad is split into left and right sides which can move independently. The lips use seven muscles to manipulate and tear at plants. Manatees use their lips and front flippers to move the plants into the mouth.  The manatee does not have front teeth, however, behind the lips, on the roof of the mouth, there are dense, ridged pads. These horny ridges, and the manatee's lower jaw, tear through ingested plant material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journey North&quot; /&gt;

===Dentition===
Manatees have four rows of teeth. There are 6 to 8 high-crowned, open-rooted molars located along each side of the upper and lower jaw giving a total of 24 to 32 flat, rough-textured teeth. Eating gritty vegetation abrades the teeth, particularly the enamel crown, however, research indicates that the enamel structure in manatee molars is weak. To compensate for this, manatee teeth are continually replaced. When anterior molars wear down, they are shed. Posterior molars erupt at the back of the row and slowly move forward to replace these like enamel crowns on a conveyor belt.  This process continues throughout the manatee's lifetime. The rate at which the teeth migrate forward depends on how quickly the anterior teeth abrade. Some studies indicate that the rate is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm/month although other studies indicate 0.1&amp;nbsp;cm/month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journey North&quot; /&gt;  This process of teeth being continually replaced is known as [[polyphyodont]]y and amongst other mammals, only occurs in [[elephant]]s and [[kangaroo]]s.

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===
[[File:mapa distribuicao Trichechus.png|right|thumb|Approximate distribution of ''Trichechus''; ''T. manatus'' in green; ''T. inunguis'' in red; ''T. senegalenis'' in orange|alt=Map drawing showing range of three manatee populations]]

Manatees inhabit the shallow, [[marsh]]y coastal areas and rivers of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (''T. manatus'', [[West Indian manatee]]), the [[Amazon Basin]] (''T. inunguis'', [[Amazonian manatee]]), and [[West Africa]] (''T. senegalensis'', [[West African manatee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/roosmalen-200802.html ''Trials of a Primatologist.''] – smithsonianmag.com. Accessed March 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

West Indian manatees prefer warmer temperatures and are known to congregate in shallow waters.  They frequently migrate through [[brackish water]] [[estuary|estuaries]] to [[freshwater]] [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. They cannot survive below 15&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F). Their natural source for warmth during winter is warm, spring-fed rivers.

[[File:Manatee.jpg||thumb|left|A group of three manatees|alt=Underwater photo of three manatees swimming along bottom]]

====West Indian====
The coast of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] is usually the northernmost range of the West Indian manatees because their low [[metabolic rate]] does not protect them in cold water. Prolonged exposure to water temperatures below 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F)&amp;nbsp; can bring about &quot;cold stress syndrome&quot; and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Rebecca |last=Basu |title=Winter is culprit in manatee death toll |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100301/NEWS01/3010320/Winter-is-culprit-in-manatee-death-toll |publisher=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |pages=1A |date=1 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142328/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100301/NEWS01/3010320/Winter-is-culprit-in-manatee-death-toll |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida manatees can move freely between [[salinity]] extremes.

Manatees have been seen as far north as [[Cape Cod]], and in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/435097/TRAVELIN-MANATEE-FAR-FROM-HOME-AGAIN.html?pg=all|title=TRAVELIN' MANATEE FAR FROM HOME AGAIN|work=Deseret News|date=23 August 1995|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2006, one was seen in New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/nyregion/07manatee.html|title=Massive Manatee Is Spotted in Hudson River|date=7 August 2006|accessdate=1 January 2016|author=Lee, Jennifer 8|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rhode Island]]'s [[Narragansett Bay]]. A manatee was spotted in the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River]] harbor near the [[Mississippi River]] in downtown Memphis in 2006, though it was later found dead 10 miles downriver in McKellar Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16160935/ns/us_news-environment/t/manatee-found-dead-tenn-lake|title=Manatee found dead in Tenn. lake|agency=Associated Press|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Indian manatee migrates into Florida rivers, such as the [[Crystal River (Florida)|Crystal]], the [[Homosassa River|Homosassa]], and the [[Chassahowitzka River]]s. The headsprings of these rivers maintain a 22&amp;nbsp;°C (72&amp;nbsp;°F) temperature all year. During November to March, about 400 West Indian manatees (according to the [[National Wildlife Refuge]]) congregate in the rivers in [[Citrus County, Florida]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

During winter, manatees often congregate near the warm-water outflows of power plants along the coast of Florida instead of migrating south as they once did.  Some conservations are concerned these manatees have become too reliant on these artificially warmed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The main water treatment plant in [[Guyana]] has four manatees that keep storage canals clear of weeds; there are also some in the ponds of the National Park in [[Georgetown, Guyana]].

Studies suggest Florida manatees must have some access to fresh water for proper [[Osmoregulation|regulation of water and salts within their bodies]].

Accurate population estimates of the Florida manatee (''T. manatus'') are difficult.  They have been called scientifically weak&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Marine Mammal Commission 1999&lt;/ref&gt; due to widely varying counts from year to year, some areas showing increases, others decreases and little strong evidence of increases except in two areas. Manatee counts are highly variable without an accurate way to estimate numbers:  In Florida in 1996, a winter survey found 2,639 manatees, in 1997, a January survey found 2,229, and a February survey found 1,706.&lt;ref name=GulDie/&gt; A statewide synoptic survey in January 2010 found 5,067 manatees living in Florida, which was a new record count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Exceptional weather conditions lead to record high manatee count|publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|date=January 20, 2010|url=http://myfwc.com/Newsroom/10/statewide/News_10_X_ManateeSynoptic2010.htm|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2016, the USFWS estimates the range-wide manatee population to be at least 13,000, with at least 6,300 in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;fws.gov&quot;&gt;http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?_ID=35428 Retrieved on 1/17/2016 from USFWS press release&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Population viability analysis|Population viability]] studies conducted in 1997 found that decreasing adult survival and eventual extinction is a probable future outcome for Florida manatees, without additional protection.&lt;ref&gt;(Marmontel, Humphrey, O'Shea 1997, Population Variability Analysis of the Florida Manatee, 1976–1992, ''Conserv. biol''., 11: 467–481)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed downgrading the manatee’s status from endangered to threatened in January 2016 after over 40 years on the endangered species list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.discovery.com/animals/record-6250-manatees-spotted-in-florida-waters-160226.htm| title=Record 6,250 Manatees Spotted in Florida Waters| date=February 26, 2016| publisher=Discovery| access-date=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil remains of Florida manatee ancestors date back about 45 million years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Amazonian====
The freshwater Amazonian manatee (''T. inunguis'') inhabits the Amazon River and its tributaries, and never ventures into salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West African====
They are found in coastal marine and estuarine habitats, and in freshwater river systems along the west coast of Africa from the [[Senegal River]] south to the [[Kwanza River]] in [[Angola]]. They live as far upriver on the [[Niger River]] as [[Koulikoro]] in [[Mali]], 2,000 km from the coast.&lt;ref name=iucnWA/&gt;

===Predation===
Overall, predation does not present a significant threat to the survival of any manatee species.

==Relation to humans==

[[File:Hpim0279.jpg|thumb|right|Antillean manatee|alt=Profile photo of out-of-water manatee]]

===Threats===
The main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects.  Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures and disease.

====Ship strikes====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nowake.jpg|thumb|A sign advising boaters to go slow enough that their motor leaves no wake|alt=Photo of sign on pole in water]] --&gt;

Their slow-moving, curious nature, coupled with dense coastal development, has led to many violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death. As a result, a large proportion of manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs, usually caused by larger vessels that do not have [[skeg]]s in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard-outboard recreational boats have. They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Many manatees have been cut in half by large vessels like ships and tug boats, even in the highly populated lower St. Johns River's narrow channels. Some are concerned that the current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081007102448/http://www.cdnn.info/news/eco/e060111.html Florida boaters killing endangered manatees]. Cyber Diver News Network. 11 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the cuts lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal. Recent testing{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} shows that manatees may be able to hear speed boats and other watercraft approaching, due to the frequency the boat makes. However, a manatee may not be able to hear the approaching boats when they are performing day-to-day activities or distractions. The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 kilohertz to 32 kilohertz.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Manatees hear on a higher frequency than would be expected for such large marine mammals. Many large boats emit very low frequencies, which confuse the manatee and explain their lack of awareness around boats. The [[Lloyd's mirror#Underwater acoustics|Lloyd's mirror]] effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Research indicates that when a boat has a higher frequency the manatees rapidly swim away from danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19990629210228data_trunc_sys.shtml Manatees hard of hearing]. Scienceagogo.com (1999-07-30). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a population model was released by the [[United States Geological Survey]] that predicted an extremely grave situation confronting the manatee in both the Southwest and Atlantic regions where the vast majority of manatees are found. It states,

:&quot;In the absence of any new management action, that is, if boat mortality rates continue to increase at the rates observed since 1992, the situation in the Atlantic and Southwest regions is dire, with no chance of meeting recovery criteria within 100 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethemanatee.org/newsprpopulationmodel.htm Long Term Prospects for Manatee Recovery Look Grim, According To New Data Released By Federal Government]. Savethemanatee.org (2003-04-29). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Hurricanes, cold stress, red tide poisoning and a variety of other maladies threaten manatees, but by far their greatest danger is from watercraft strikes, which account for about a quarter of Florida manatee deaths,&quot; said study curator John Jett.&lt;ref name=uf&gt;[http://news.ufl.edu/2007/07/03/manatee-3/ ufl.edu]. News.ufl.edu (2007-07-03). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to marine mammal [[veterinarian]]s:

:&quot;The severity of mutilations for some of these individuals can be astounding – including long term survivors with completely severed tails, major tail mutilations, and multiple disfiguring dorsal lacerations. These injuries not only cause gruesome wounds, but may also impact population processes by reducing calf production (and survival) in wounded females – observations also speak to the likely pain and suffering endured&quot;.&lt;ref name=GulDie/&gt; In an example, they cited one case study of a small calf &quot;with a severe dorsal mutilation trailing a decomposing piece of dermis and muscle as it continued to accompany and nurse from its mother...by age 2 its dorsum was grossly deformed and included a large protruding rib fragment visible.&quot;&lt;ref name=GulDie/&gt;

These veterinarians go on to state:

:&quot;the overwhelming documentation of gruesome wounding of manatees leaves no room for denial. Minimization of this injury is ''explicit'' in the Recovery Plan, several state statutes, and federal laws, and ''implicit'' in our society's ethical and moral standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=GulDie/&gt;

In 2009, of the 429 Florida manatees recorded dead, 97 were killed by commercial and recreational vessels, which broke the earlier record number of 95 set in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/research/manatee/rescue-mortality-response/mortality-statistics/|title=Manatee Mortality Statistics|publisher=Fish and Wildlife Research Institute|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red tide====
Another cause of manatee deaths are [[red tide]]s, a term used for the proliferation, or &quot;blooms&quot;, of the microscopic marine algae, ''[[Karenia brevis]]''.  This [[dinoflagellate]] produces [[brevetoxin]]s that can have toxic effects on the [[central nervous system]] of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional threats====
Manatees occasionally ingest fishing gear (hooks, metal weights, etc.) while feeding. These foreign materials do not appear to harm manatees, except for [[monofilament fishing line|monofilament line]] or string, which can block a manatee's digestive system and slowly kill it.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Manatees can also be crushed in water control structures (navigation locks, [[floodgate]]s, etc.), drown in pipes and [[culvert]]s, and are occasionally killed by entanglement in fishing gear, primarily [[crab pot]] float lines.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Conservation===
All three species of manatee are listed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]] as vulnerable to extinction.

It is illegal under federal and Florida law to injure or harm a manatee. They are classified as &quot;endangered&quot; by both the state and the federal governments.

The [[MV Freedom Star|MV ''Freedom Star'']] and [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']], ships used by [[NASA]] to tow [[space shuttle]] [[solid rocket booster]]s back to [[Kennedy Space Center]], are propelled only by water jets to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the [[Banana River]] where the ships are based.

Brazil outlawed hunting in 1973 in an effort to preserve the species. Deaths by boat strikes are still common.

In January 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that the West Indian Manatee be reclassified from an &quot;endangered&quot; status to &quot;threatened&quot; as improvements to habitat conditions, population growth and reductions of threats have all increased.  The proposal will not affect current federal protections.&lt;ref name=&quot;fws.gov&quot;/&gt;

As of February 2016, 6,250 manatees were reported swimming in Florida's springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Hunting===
[[File:Manatee photo.jpg|thumb|''Trichechus'' sp.|alt=Underwater profile photo of light-colored animal with small flippers]]
Manatees were traditionally hunted by indigenous Caribbean people. When [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the region, hunting was already an established trade, although this is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambergriscaye.com/25years/huntingformanatees.html Hunting for Manatees]. Ambergriscaye.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary hunting method was for the hunter to approach in a dugout canoe, offering bait to attract it close enough to temporarily stun it with a blow near the head from an oar-like pole. Many times the creature would flip over, leaving it vulnerable to further attacks.

From manatee hides, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] made [[shield|war shields]], [[canoe]]s, and [[shoe]]s, though manatees were predominantly hunted for their abundant meat.

Later, manatees were hunted for their bones, which were used to make &quot;special potions&quot;. Until the 1800s, museums paid as much as $100 for bones or hides. Though hunting was banned in 1893, poaching continues today.

===Captivity===
[[File:Manatee at Sea World Orlando Mar 10.JPG|thumb|left|A manatee at SeaWorld, Florida|alt=Underwater photo of manatee]]
The oldest manatee in captivity is [[Snooty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aronson|first1=Claire|title=Guinness World Records names Snooty of Bradenton as 'Oldest Manatee in Captivity'|url=http://www.bradenton.com/2015/06/26/5867910/guinness-world-records-names-snooty.html|website=bradenton.com|publisher=Bradenton Herald|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[South Florida Museum]]'s Parker Manatee Aquarium in [[Bradenton, Florida]]. Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948 (age 67), Snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births. Raised entirely in captivity, Snooty will never be released into the wild. As such he is the only manatee at the Aquarium, and one of a select few captive manatees in the United States, that is allowed to interact with human handlers. This makes him uniquely suitable to manatee research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Snooty the Manatee|url= |location= |publisher= South Florida Museum |pages= |date= |isbn= 9-781569-444412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the [[Tierpark Berlin|Tierpark]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Nuremberg Zoo]], in [[ZooParc de Beauval]] in France and in the [[Aquarium of Genoa]] in Italy. The [[River Safari]] at [[Singapore]] features seven of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/manatees-move-worlds-largest-freshwater-aquarium-river-safari-20130313 |title= Manatees move into world's largest freshwater aquarium at River Safari |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also included in the plans for a new [[National Wildlife Conservation Park]] in [[Bristol, England]], whose first exhibit is due to open in summer 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/introducing-bristol-zoo-s-new-conservation-park-wild-place |title= Introducing Bristol Zoo’s new conservation park – Wild Place  |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the manatees as an addition as early as 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7510712.stm |title= Zoo submits £70m park proposals|date=2008-07-17 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
The manatee has been linked to folklore on [[mermaid]]s. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] ground the bones to treat [[asthma]] and earache. In [[West Africa]]n folklore, they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human. Killing one was [[taboo]] and required penance.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cooper92&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |page=157 |year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=1-85538-118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manatees were featured in the &quot;[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]&quot; episode of ''[[South Park]]'', as the creative force behind the television show ''[[Family Guy]]''. The manatees were shown to be living in a tank at [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX Studios]] which was filled with &quot;idea balls.&quot; The manatees randomly selected the idea balls to make the jokes for the show. They are also revealed as being &quot;the only animal unmoved by terrorist threats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gournelos|first=Ted |title=Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of South Park|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date=2009|pages=142–43|isbn=9780739137215|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PCI23BOylt4C&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
